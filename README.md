[/COLOR]
TCMap is a tool that marks every TC in the server on the game map.

It also allowes you to see the name of the players authorised in that  TC just by hovering your mouse over the desired marker, so that a tooltip with those players' names will pop up.

It is mainly an admin tool, but can also be used for example on last day before wipe, or even if you want to host a really hardcore server where people can't really hide.
